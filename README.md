# Exploratory-data-Analysis---Retail

This is a Retail Store Exploratory Data Analysis project. Here I have used a Retail store dataset as a csv file and imported into Jupyter Notebook and by using Python data analysis package Pandas and data visualization packages like Matplotlib and Seaborn. Then I performed data cleaning , data merging and data transformation on this dataset. Here I tried to analyse data on various factors and parameters, and displyed them using several visualization mehtods like graph, bar chart, pischart , scatterplot etcc.. And generated several retail business insights and business problems by exploring the data.
